# Removes all firewall rules involving the IP address

# Issues UCI commands at the command line to remove the device and restart the firewall

# example- mudfile nest.json for nest Thermostat:
# First we block everything:
#uci set firewall.@rule[-1].target=REJECT
#uci set firewall.@rule[-1].proto=all
#uci set firewall.@rule[-1].src=*
#uci set firewall.@rule[-1].src_ip=192.168.2.254
#uci set firewall.@rule[-1].src_port=*
#uci set firewall.@rule[-1].dest=*
#uci set firewall.@rule[-1].dest_ip=*
#uci set firewall.@rule[-1].dest_port=*
